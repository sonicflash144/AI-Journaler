{"fileName":"4-26-2024, 9.04.05 PM.md","text":"I took a Precal test today and had to skip two questions. This, admittedly, annoyed me a great deal, mostly because one of the questions I had to skip was a question I had seen many times before, just a few weeks back so I was out of practice with it. It was a graphing question that always took me forever, but usually I could eventually see what the shape of the graph was supposed to be, but today I just couldnâ€™t figure it out. I wasted a lot of time on this question instead of checking the other questions on the test. To be honest, my frustration was as much of an ego thing as a GPA fear thing, because I had this growing anger watching other people turn in their tests early as I stared at this one problem that should not have been this difficult but was simply not making any sense."}
